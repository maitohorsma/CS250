Module 8 Journal:

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  User Stories are how user needs are interpretted and implemented. Breaking down needs into small stories makes it simpler to get things done, and to know when the Definition of Done has been met. Instead of looking at the whole project, things are taken in pieces. Incremental updates to the program, done one User Story at a time, will build upon each other until the project is complete. Taking work piece by piece is less overwhelming than trying to understand every aspect of a project all at once. The User Stories are created by listening to the customer and discovering what items are required. When the Definition of Done is met, you move on to the next User Story. Incrementally, the job gets done, while staying focussed on each item.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  
  Agile can be so helpful for the Software Development Life Cycle. The Scrum methodology is a good option. I hope to be sucessful at using the Scrum methodology in the future. Everything that Scrum tries to do can lead to succesfull software development. Product backlog creation, Sprint planning, Sprint action, testing/release, and the Sprint retrospective leads to success. Its a tried and true methodology that works. I plan to use open and honest communication when I am working with a team. I plan to be dedicated to the Sprint deadlines and to meeting the Definition of Done. I also plan to be flexible and open to changes, as every project will have items that come up in the middle of a Sprint.
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  The most important thing to be a good team member in software development is to communicate open and honestly. If a team cannot communicate effectively, meeting the Definition of Done will be nearly impossible. Because each team member has different responsibilities that may only overlap some of the time, they need to be updating the rest of the team frequently on progress and hinderances. In Scrum, the best way to do this would be Daily Scrum Meetings, with additional communication as needed via face-to-face conversations and electronic communication.
